        the game.<br><br>It didn't take too long. In fact, in my opinion it was a
        little too short. Appropriate for the length of a standard EVN perhaps, but
        you wish that it took a bit more time to flesh out the world of Orion.<br><br>So,
        the good thing is that the bones are all there. All the main nodes that should
        be there are there, and the logic as far as I can see it is sound.<br><br>Unfortunately
        even a beautiful skeleton is just that, and the various flaws I want to point
        out still stems from the problem that there isn't enough content to flesh
        out Orion. To start with, Orion is a world of Unionism but you barely get
        a sense of it from complains mouthed by various characters. The main character
        is a naive kid who is shielded from this reality, but even then he should've
        seen some acts that are considered 'abnormal' in our society in his daily
        life. We don't get that. During the whole adventure, since you're constantly
        on the move there's no time to appreciate the world. All we get are verbal
        woes from characters we barely scratch the surface.<br><br>In fact the only
        character you'll feel familiar with is Virgil. Everyone else, even your own
        bro Louca feels terribly distant, and while you can feel his (almost disturbing)
        love for the MC it... could've been more elaborated. I wonder how many people
        will feel tricked by the Mari CG. She totally isn't important at all in the
        story and could've been replaced by a faceless goon for all I care. Really,
        I enjoy the game quite a bit, but I must repeat again and again that there
        just isn't enough flesh or time to make these seemingly cool characters endearing
        or even memorable.<br><br>I guess that's the tradeoff for having full voice
        acting in the game. This is quite high quality stuff, but can be seen hollow
        in the inside.\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"UserReviewCardContent_Footer\">\r\n\t\t\t<div

        class=\"date_posted\">Posted: 30 September</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis VN
        is amazing. The story telling and concepts the game portrays are very interesting
        and pulled me in immidietaly. I almost instantly fell in love with many of
        the characters, and although that may depend on the person, I picked a few
        favorites very quickly that I found to love through out the whole entire VN
        <br><br>In addition to the fantastic story-telling this VN has many different
        paths in which may lead to a &quot;bad end&quot; or a &quot;good ending&quot;
        and you need certain specific ones to get the &quot;True Ending&quot; Which
        makes the game a ton of fun, I always found myself thinking about which choice
        I was going to make over and over again, knowing that my decisions do have
        an impact on the game. <br><br>For those who beleive the game isn't that long
        or they felt as if the ending wasn't complete, that is because it wasn't.
        It was not the True ending and they most likely picked the wrong choices which
        in my opinion is one of the best parts about a Visual Novel. Trying to trust
        your own self in order to see how your own actions reflect in a game is one
        of the most rewarding feelings even if it is the &quot;bad&quot; choice. <br><br>Furthermore,
        the sound design in this game is very nice, which made reading this visual
        novel even better, I found myself enjoying the music more than I realized
        because it fit the mood so well of what I was reading. The art is also amazing,
        and really portrays the game very nicely. This is a Full-voiced game which
        is incredible since all of the voice actor is done very well. I never found
        a voice that I thought was annoying unless the character was, in fact, suppose
        to be annoying. Basically, the voices fit all the characters really well and
        it was done very nicely. You will fall in love with the voices, sounds, and
        art of this Visual Novel. <br><br>Over all, I believe that this VN deserves
        more credit than it has recieved, and if you enjoy reading visual novels in
        your spare time, you'll fall in love with this one. :3\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div

        class=\"date_posted\">Posted: 29 September</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm only
        in chapter 4 of the game, but I have some constructive criticism. I've had
        multiple &quot;choices&quot; to make so far in the game, however many of them
        appear to be completely inconsequential. Stuff like &quot;stay here&quot;
        vs &quot;make a run for it.&quot; Except the &quot;make a run for it&quot;
        option has you recaptured a second after, and there doesn't seem to be any
        indication that it has any impact on the story that &quot;stay here' wouldn't
        have had. <br><br>In chapter 3 I ran into two choices, both that led to really
        vague game overs. Speaking of which, the game overs I've been getting have
        been very oddly written. It seems like the game expects me to be discovering
        these endings on replay, because they don't make very much sense. Almost as
        if I were stumbling into the end or middle of a game's story without any context.
        Like in one ending I successfully meet a character I needed to meet. Then
        the game ends with &quot;Was this the right one?&quot; &quot;No. But I can't
        say why. Sorry.&quot;  <br><br>It is too early to really render a final verdict,
        but my initial impression isn't as good as I was hoping. If you're a fan of
        VR's, itching for a new one to play, and don't mind dropping the 11-12 dollars,
        then based on my current impressions I'd say maybe go for this.\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div

        class=\"date_posted\">Posted: 3 October</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: I was
        a Kickstarter backer for this game.<br><br>I wasn't really sure if I should
        give this a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Ultimately, I enjoyed the plot threads,
        the music, and the character designs. However, a lot of the nine different
        endings were basically unsatisfying with a lot of different plot threads dropped.
        For the first eight endings, this is fairly deliberate as the premise of the
        game basically forces you to try different scenarios and keep playing to finally
        put most of the pieces together. And I use the word &quot;most&quot; in that
        last sentence on purpose: the ninth &quot;true&quot; ending is basically the
        ending that reveals the most information in terms of build-up but kind of
        the worst ending for all of the dangling plot threads and character development
        in the game. <br><br>Which would really be my biggest complaint, I think,
        with the game. All the characters except for Sam and MAYBE Virgil are basically
        stock figures that don't get much life of their own, motivations given to
        the characters are weak or nonexistent, and the game spends far too much time
        going &quot;WELP BYE!&quot; to characters other than Sam and forgetting that
        they exist at all. Finally, I had a lot of high hopes for the political intrigue
        and worldbuilding that were mentioned in the Kickstarter campaign only to
        find that there's really only the barest nod to both.<br><br>In the end, I
        don't think I wasted my investment on the Kickstarter campaign, nor was I
        bored during the two hours I was working out all nine endings. I even hope
        Reuben Lack and his team put together another VN in the future -- I just hope
        the do it with deeper development in the world and characters.\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div
