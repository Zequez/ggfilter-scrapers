# GGFilter Scrapers

GGFilter is no longer maintained and the project has been stale for some years now. You can still access to see the working interface, but the scrapers broke and I just moved on to other things.

The app can currently be accessed on [GGFilter.com](http://ggfilter.com), it works, but all the data is outdated.

To deploy really not much:

```
git push origin master
```

Or the alias:

```
rake dist:deploy
```
